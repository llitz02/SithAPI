# SithAPI
using for sith translator

Not really sure what to do here to take this further. Didn't think about this when I wrote the idea in lab 3,
but it's a pretty simple thing and not a whole lot I can think to do with it.

I think it works, but I also am not sure how to test that.

this is an area of the programming world I don't really understand, 
and I didnt get really ask any question because class hass been dead the past two weeks.
